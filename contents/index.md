## Who are we?

The Software Workers Guild was started by [Amy Ciavolino][1], [Lisa Neigut][2], and [Akiva Leffert][3] completely based on [this tweet][4].
Instead of making golden key-caps, we build this tool for responding to recruiters.
If you want to help us produce and distribute golden key-caps, get in touch.
We still want them.
